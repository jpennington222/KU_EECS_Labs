To compile the program, type "make" then enter.

This lab was made using the cycle serves due to Eaton Hall being closed.

To run the program type "./Lab07 "patients.txt" "doctors.txt"" then enter.

Patients = Max Heap

Doctors = Min Heap

The sample files should be formatted in the following example:

									adam,conner,22
									peyton,barber,1
									john,kenny,23
									tevin,coleman,10
									royce,freeman,2
									derrius,guice,15
									chris,thompson,14
									dan,harris,21
									damien,harris,5
									duke,johnson,9
									rashaad,penny,28
									austin,ekeler,4

Follow the on-screen instructions to execute the program.

For updating either the patient's or doctor's key, the entry is removed from the
heap and then reinserted as a new entry.
