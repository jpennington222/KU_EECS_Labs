1. It is advantageous to use priority heaps in hospital management because it is a useful tool to see which patient should be treated next.
   This data structure makes accessing the highest priority patients easy and effective so that they can be treated before lower priority patients.
   This data structure also makes seeing which doctors are available easy and effective.

2. Some other features that would be added to make this system applicable in a real-world setting would be to have the patient's general condition saved.
   This could affect the priority. For example, a 16 year old with a broken arm is less severe than a 80 year old with a broken arm. Another feature is
   to have each doctor have his or her own heap to manage his or her patients. This would allow the doctor to see which patients need help the soonest.

3. To apply priority heaps to product recommendations, the most liked recommendation should be given the highest priority. If this were the case, buyers
   could quickly see what the most viewed and liked reviews are before purchasing the product. This would give the buyer the most useful information when
   searching for a product to purchase.
