To compile the program, type "make" then enter.

To run the program type "./Lab05" then enter.

The program will create 5 sets of hash tables that implement double hashing and quadratic probing.

The table size for each hash table is 1,000,003.

The R value for double hashing is 773.

The maximum k value is 25.

Below is the process that the program is executing:

Set 1:
  Initialize random seed. The range of data should be from 1 to 5,000,000 and the input size should be 0.1*m.
  Insert 0.1*m value into the tables using a specific insertion method (quadratic or double hashing)
  Record the time it took to build the table.
  Find 0.01*m random values ranging from 1 to 5,000,000 and report if it is in the table.
  Repeat for both tables

Set 2:
  Initialize random seed. The range of data should be from 1 to 5,000,000 and the input size should be 0.2*m.
  Insert 0.2*m value into the tables using a specific insertion method (quadratic or double hashing)
  Record the time it took to build the table.
  Find 0.02*m random values ranging from 1 to 5,000,000 and report if it is in the table.
  Repeat for both tables

Set 3:
  Initialize random seed. The range of data should be from 1 to 5,000,000 and the input size should be 0.3*m.
  Insert 0.3*m value into the tables using a specific insertion method (quadratic or double hashing)
  Record the time it took to build the table.
  Find 0.03*m random values ranging from 1 to 5,000,000 and report if it is in the table.
  Repeat for both tables

Set 4:
  Initialize random seed. The range of data should be from 1 to 5,000,000 and the input size should be 0.4*m.
  Insert 0.4*m value into the tables using a specific insertion method (quadratic or double hashing)
  Record the time it took to build the table.
  Find 0.04*m random values ranging from 1 to 5,000,000 and report if it is in the table.
  Repeat for both tables

Set 5:
  Initialize random seed. The range of data should be from 1 to 5,000,000 and the input size should be 0.5*m.
  Insert 0.5*m value into the tables using a specific insertion method (quadratic or double hashing)
  Record the time it took to build the table.
  Find 0.05*m random values ranging from 1 to 5,000,000 and report if it is in the table.
  Repeat for both tables

After each set is evaluated, a table is printed that displays the results.
