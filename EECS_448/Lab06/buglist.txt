1) When checking peekFront(), it does not return the first entry. It looks at the back of the queue.
2) dequeue() is void. Therefore, it does not return the value that was dequeued.
3) dequeue() is removing the entries from the back, not the front.
4) There are memory leaks when trying to delete a queue that is not empty. Either the destructor or dequeue() is not working correctly

Overall, the queue is behaving like a stack.
